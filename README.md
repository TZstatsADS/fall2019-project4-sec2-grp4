+ Project summary: In this project, we worked on the Netflix movies and ratings data using the specific alogorithm assigned from the Collaborative filtering literature. First, we implemented the Stochastic Gradient Descent method. Next, to better regularize, we implemented the method of Temporal Dynamics to include the time effect for both users' and movies' ratings. In our last step, we conducted post processing methods, comparing KNN and Kernel Ridge Regression. Before implementing the post processing methods, the RMSE is 1.062. Post processing results improved RMSE to 0.7007 for KNN, and xxx for Kernel Ridge Regression.
